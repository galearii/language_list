# [Language List](https://github.com/scsmith/language_list) Tailored for Project Dill
A list of languages based upon ISO-639-1 and ISO-639-3 with functions to retrieve only common languages, with `iso_639_1: zh` changed to refer to simplified Chinese and a non-standard `iso_639_1: zh-t` added to refer to traditional Chinese in languages.yml.

For documentation, refer to the [GitHub page of the original gem](https://github.com/scsmith/language_list).
